me analyze the parameters and provide recommendations based on the Gemini documentation.

Current Parameters Analysis
Your current setup:

Gemini 1.0 Pro
Batch size: 250 calls per chunk
Average tokens: 30K per request
Threads: 50
Output: 6-8K tokens
Calculations and Limitations
Token Usage Per Minute:
250 calls × 30K tokens = 7.5M tokens per batch
50 threads × 7.5M = 375M tokens potential concurrent load
Gemini Rate Limits 1:
Input tokens per minute limit: 4M tokens
Your usage (375M) far exceeds the 4M tokens/minute limit
Concurrent Processing:
Each request uses approximately 30K input tokens
With 4M tokens/minute limit, maximum sustainable requests:
4M tokens ÷ 30K tokens per request = ~133 requests per minute
Recommended Parameters
Batch Size:
RECOMMENDED_BATCH_SIZE = 100  # Reduced from 250
# Calculation: 100 calls × 30K tokens = 3M tokens per batch
# This stays under the 4M tokens/minute limit
Thread Count:
RECOMMENDED_THREADS = 20  # Reduced from 50
# Allows for better distribution of the token quota
# 20 threads × 100 batch size = 2000 potential concurrent requests
Token Management:
MAX_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE = 4_000_000  # From documentation
TOKENS_PER_REQUEST = 30_000
SAFE_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = MAX_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE // TOKENS_PER_REQUEST  # ~133
Implementation Strategy
Rate Limiting:
from ratelimit import limits, sleep_and_retry




Root Cause Analysis
The error you're encountering is a 429 "Too Many Requests" error with a "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED" status, which indicates you've exceeded the API rate limits. This is happening because:

High concurrent load:
50 threads running simultaneously
250 calls per chunk
Large token usage (~30K tokens per request)
Resource limitations:
Vertex AI has rate limits to prevent system overload
The high volume of concurrent requests is triggering these limits
Key Points to Consider
Token Usage:
Each request is using approximately 30K tokens
Output is limited to 6-8K tokens
This high token count multiplied by concurrent requests creates significant load
Batch Processing:
Current batch size of 250 calls may be too aggressive
50 threads running simultaneously creates high concurrent load
Best Practices and Recommendations
Implement Rate Limiting:
from ratelimit import limits, sleep_and_retry
import time

# Define rate limits (example: 100 calls per minute)
@sleep_and_retry
@limits(calls=100, period=60)
def make_gemini_api_call(data):
    # Your API call implementation
    pass
Reduce Concurrency:
# Reduce thread count and batch size
THREAD_COUNT = 20  # Reduced from 50
BATCH_SIZE = 100   # Reduced from 250

def process_batches(data):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=THREAD_COUNT) as executor:
        for batch in chunks(data, BATCH_SIZE):
            executor.submit(process_batch, batch)
Implement Exponential Backoff:
def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(wait_time)
Summary and Implementation Strategy
Immediate Actions:
Reduce thread count to 20-25
Decrease batch size to 100 calls per chunk
Implement rate limiting and backoff mechanisms
Long-term Optimizations:
Consider token optimization in prompts
Monitor and adjust based on API usage patterns
Implement request queuing system for better load management
Monitoring:
def monitor_api_usage():
    # Track API calls
    current_calls = 0
    start_time = time.time()
    
    def log_call():
        nonlocal current_calls
        current_calls += 1
        if current_calls % 100 == 0:
            elapsed = time.time() - start_time
            print(f"Processed {current_calls} calls in {elapsed:.2f} seconds")
    
    return log_call
By implementing these changes, you should see a significant reduction in 429 errors while maintaining reasonable throughput for your application.
