Instruction:
         You are an AI expert in analyzing call or chat transcripts and getting highly accurate insights.
         Given the actual input context below which is a call conversation with agent and customer separated by newline, understand and analyze the text and accurately determine the following items from the input conversation. Do not add or give any information which are not part of the call transcript.
         Step 1) Precise Summary of the entire conversation without missing any details. Do not Hallucinate.
         Step 2) Precisely determine Overall Sentiment of the customer from 'negative', 'positive' or 'neutral'. Use key 'overall_sentiment'. If multiple sentiments occured in same call, give end of the call sentiment as 'overall_sentiment'.
         Step 3) Accurately Determine all the topics( max 3-4 topics) without missing any  intention of customer in one to three words for the given input conversation. Use key 'topics'. This will be a list of dictionaries.
         Step 4) For each determined topic in step 3, provide evidence sentence on how and why you determined that topic with a key called "relevant_phrase". While preparing make sure to rephrase evidence to have proper english grammar fluency and concise and crisp. Do not give the exact transcript. Keep it short.
         Step 5) For each determined topic in step 3, provide a 'confidence_score' with values from 0-100%. This should tell how confident you are in providing the topics for the given sentence.
         Step 6) For each determined topic in step 3, accurately identify its sentiment as one of 'negative', 'positive' or 'neutral' considering when the extracted topic's relevant sentence in step 3 says some improvement required or something needs to be done or something missing   then the sentiment should be negative. use key 'topic_sentiment'.
         Step 7.a) Overall intention of the input conversation in strictly not more than four-five words. use key "intention".
         Step 7.b) Primary intention of the customer given input conversation in strictly not more than four-five words. use key 'customer_intention'.
         Step 7.c) for Overall intention of the input conversation provide a 'confidence_score_overall' with values from 0-100%. This should tell how confident you are in providing the overall intention of the customer for the given conversation.
         Step 7.d) Sometimes customer might call for multiple things or one thing leads to another in the call. For example a customer can call for high bill but after discussion he would want to disconnect due to high bill. in that case the overall intention of the call will be 'High Bill' and 'customer_intention_secondary' will be 'Account Disconnection'. In such cases where you find more than one intention of the call, use key Overall_secondary_intention and provide the secondary intention of the call.
         Step 7.e) for Overall_secondary_intention of the input conversation provide a 'confidence_score_customer_intention_secondary' with values from 0-100%. This should tell how confident you are in providing the Overall_secondary_intention of the customer for the given conversation. It can be null also if you don't find any secondary intention as such.
         Step 7.f) for customer_intention of the input conversation provide a 'confidence_score_customer_intention_primary' with values from 0-100%. This should tell how confident you are in providing the customer_intention of the customer for the given conversation. It can be null also if you don't find any primary intention as such.
         Step 8) Determine whether customer was satisfied or not with agent resolution and interaction  with a binary response ‘Yes’ or ‘No’  at the end of the call conversation with a key ‘customer_satisfied’. 
         Step 9) Give reason for customer satisfaction if the customer is satisfied or give reason for unsatisfaction if customer is not satisfied. Use key 'customer_res_reason'.
         Step 10) From the input conversation accurately identify detailed summary of agent actions and what agent has provided as resolution to customer's concern with a key called 'agent_resolution'.
         Step 11) Was the agent able to resolve the customer's concern for the field 'agent_resolved_customer_concern' answer strictly in binary like 'yes' or 'no'.
         Step 12) If the customer not satisfied with resolutions provided by agent they might ask agent to transfer the call to their Supervisor or they can ask to escalate. Give answer in binary like 'yes' or 'no' for field 'supervisor_escalation'.
         Step 13) If the customer not satisfied with resolutions provided by agent they might be frustrated or angry. Give answer for field 'emotion' as frustrated or angry. use key 'resolution_emotion'
         Step 14) Agents sometimes might tell customers that they will call customers back with proper solution. In that case for the given field 'callback_promied' give answer in binary like 'yes' or 'no'
         Step 15) Sometime the call might get disconnected or abondoned by customer. If you feel the call has been abondoned by customer or some disconnection happened give answer for field 'call_disconnection' in binary like 'yes' or 'no'.
         Step 16) Sometimes the customer might not feel satisfactory or Agents might not be able to help instantly. in that case they create a troubleshoot ticket. If you find such case where customer asking to create a ticket or Agent is telling that he will create a ticket give answer in binary like 'yes' or 'no' for the key called 'troubleshoot_ticket'.

         Step 18) Determine whether the conversation mention that customer has called earlier for the same problem and calling again, generate this step response with a key 'repeat_call_reason' and provide answer to  the reason for repeat call and how many times they called for same problem, and also add evidence of the sentence what customer exactly said on repeated call.
         Step 19) Determine precise and accurate reason in couple of words from the conversation transcript, why the customer want to disconnect their service with evidence from transcript. If you are unsure or unable to determine exact reason just say "unable to determine" with a key called "reason_for_disconnect".
        Step 20) Always give the right answer without any hallucinations.

        Step 27) in start of the call after the agent gave  the resolution for customer intents in step 22, provide if customer was frustrated at what level(low/high/very high). use the key "start_of_call_cust_frustration_after_agent_resolution"
        Step 28) in start of the call after the agent gave  the resolution  for customer intents in  step 22, provide the sentiment after getting resolution from (positive/negative/neutral). use the key "start_of_call_cust_sentiment_after_agent_resolution"
        
        Step 29) in end of the call Accurately Determine what was the sentiment of the customer during the end part of the call. Use key 'end_of_call_sentiment'. The answer should be strictly from (positive/negative/neutral). Do not consider the greetings.

            * The rephrased question should be self-contained and easily understood without needing additional context from the conversation. 
            * Avoid irrelevant questions like "How are you?" or any profanity.
            For the response use the json key 'cust_question'. The question needs to be relevant. 
            Step 42.c) For each rephrased customer question, extract the agent's direct response from the conversation.
            * Rephrase the agent's response to ensure grammatical accuracy, clarity, and conciseness. 
            * Ensure the answer accurately reflects the agent's statement without omitting any crucial information. For the response use the json key 'agent_answer'.  Do not mention any profanity in the generated answer
            Step 42.d) Based on the Step 42.b(cust_question) and Step 42.c(agent_answer) Output, look at the conversation and answer accurately whether the agent's response has actually answered customers question and customer is satisfied with agent's response for the question. format this response as json key and value. for example 'is_cust_satisfied_with_answer': 'Yes', 'question_answered_properly': 'Yes'. Use the answer from (yes/no/partial/unable_to_determine).
