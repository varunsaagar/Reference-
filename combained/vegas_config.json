Instruction:
         You are an AI expert in analyzing call or chat transcripts and getting highly accurate insights.
         Given the actual input context below which is a call conversation with agent and customer separated by newline, understand and analyze the text and accurately determine the following items from the input conversation,
         Step 1) Precise Summary of the entire conversation without missing any details.
         Step 2) When customer says some problem or issue,  something improvement required, something is not there or happening, something needs to be done or something missing the overall sentiment should be negative. Never Give the wrong sentiment. Precisely determine Overall Sentiment as one of negative, positive or neutral. 
         Step 3) Accurately Determine all the topics without missing any  intention of customer in one to three words for the given input conversation.
         Step 4) For each determined topic in step 2, provide evidence sentence on how and why you determined that topic with a key called "relevant_phrase".
         Step 5) For each determined topic in step 2, provide a 'confidence_score' with values from 0-100%. This should tell how confident you are in providing the topics for the given sentence.
         Step 6) For each determined topic in step 2, accurately identify its sentiment as one of positive, negative or neutral considering when the extracted topic's relevant sentence in step 3 says some improvement required or something needs to be done or something missing   then the sentiment should be negative.
         Step 7.a) Overall intention of the input conversation in strictly one to three words.
         Step 7.b) for Overall intention of the input conversation provide a 'confidence_score_overall' with values from 0-100%. This should tell how confident you are in providing the overall intention of the customer for the given conversation.
         Step 7.c) Sometimes customer might call for multiple things or one thing leads to another in the call. For example a customer can call for high bill but after discussion he would want to disconnect due to high bill. in that case the overall intention of the call will be 'High Bill' and 'customer_intention_secondary' will be 'Account Disconnection'. In such cases where you find more than one intention of the call, use key Overall_secondary_intention and provide the secondary intention of the call.
         Step 7.d) for Overall_secondary_intention of the input conversation provide a 'confidence_score_customer_intention_secondary' with values from 0-100%. This should tell how confident you are in providing the Overall_secondary_intention of the customer for the given conversation. It can be null also if you don't find any secondary intention as such
         Step 8) Determine whether customer was satisfied or not with agent resolution and interaction  with a binary response ‘Yes’ or ‘No’  at the end of the call conversation with a key ‘customer_satisfied’.
         Step 9) From the input conversation determine the customer intention in two to three words. 
         Step 10) From the input conversation accurately identify detailed summary of agent actions and what agent has provided as resolution to customer's concern with a key called 'agent_resolution'.
         Step 11) Was the agent able to resolve the customer's concern for the field 'agent_resolved_customer_concern' answer strictly in binary like 'yes' or 'no'.
         Step 12) If the customer not satified with resolutions provided by agent they might ask agent to transfer the call to their Supervisor or they can ask to escalate. Give answer in binary like 'yes' or 'no' for field 'supervisor_escalation'.
         Step 13) If the customer not satified with resolutions provided by agent they might be frustrated or angry. Give answer for field 'emotion' as frustrated or angry.
         Step 14) Agents sometimes might tell customers that they will call customers back with proper solution. In that case for the given field 'callback_promied' give answer in binary like 'yes' or 'no'
         Step 15) Sometime the call might get disconnected or abondoned by customer. If you feel the call has been abondoned by customer or some disconnection happened give answer for field 'call_disconnection' in binary like 'yes' or 'no'.
         Step 16) Sometimes the customer might not feel satisfactory or Agents might not be able to help instantly. in that case they create a troubleshoot ticket. If you find such case where customer asking to create a ticket or Agent is telling that he will create a ticket give answer in binary like 'yes' or 'no' for the key called 'troubleshoot_ticket'.
         Step 17) Understand and answer precisely what exactly is the customer issue in detail with a key called "customer_issue".
         Step 18) Determine precise and accurate reason in couple of words from the conversation transcript, why the customer want to disconnect their service with evidence from transcript. If you are unsure or unable to determine exact reason just say "unable to determine" with a key called "reason_for_disconnect".
         Step 19) Determine whether the conversation mention that customer has called earlier for the same problem and calling again, generate this step response with a key 'repeat_call_reason' and provide answer to  the reason for repeat call and how many times they called for same problem, and also add evidence of the sentence what customer exactly said on repeated call.
         Step 20) Analyze, Observe and understand the below two example input and output to strictly generate output as python dictionary and Make sure to generate the output response as below mentioned python dictionary format (consider this as output template) with all keys from Actual Input content.
